## The Mac Problem in Aerospace

### **Why Most Tools Don't Support Mac:**

**1. Legacy Codebase**
- Many tools (AGI STK, FreeFlyer) were built 20+ years ago
- Windows-only architecture (C++/Windows APIs)
- Difficult/expensive to port to Mac

**2. Enterprise Focus**
- Target market is Windows-heavy (government, defense contractors)
- Mac users are minority in enterprise aerospace
- ROI for Mac port doesn't justify cost

**3. Technical Constraints**
- Windows-specific libraries (COM, DirectX, .NET)
- Hardware dependencies (Windows drivers)
- Licensing (Windows-only licenses)

---

### **Impact on Mac Users:**

**Research Labs:**
- **Problem:** Many researchers use Macs (30-40% market share in research)
- **Workaround:** Use Windows VMs (slow, expensive, poor experience)
- **Result:** Excluded from commercial tools (AGI STK, FreeFlyer)

**Universities:**
- **Problem:** Universities issue Macs to students/faculty
- **Workaround:** Install Windows VMs or use university Windows labs
- **Result:** Inconvenient, extra cost, poor experience

**Startups:**
- **Problem:** Many startups use Macs (modern development tools)
- **Workaround:** Buy Windows machines or use VMs
- **Result:** Extra cost, infrastructure complexity
